But seriously 20 bucks gone for an non-flavored half sandwich. And a line that is long, especially if you want seating. I''m down to just take a quick look where Sally and Harry sat and leave to the other delis all around NYC. Oh and they accept Samsung pay.','October 26, 2016','2025-01-27 10:23:17');

Came here for lunch on a random weekday afternoon and when we arrived, there was a line forming already. The space is a bit cramped. You''ll get to know your neighbors soon enough. The pizza is just delightful and delicious. It''s a ncie plus that you get to see them firing up the pizzas in the corner. The major issue with Roberta''s is the trek out to the Williamsburg/Bushwick.','October 26, 2016','2025-01-27 10:23:17');

INSERT INTO reviews (id, restaurant_id, user_id, rating, comments, date, created_at) VALUES(16,6,1,4,'Barbecue aficionados agree that Billy Durney is cooking up some of the best Texas-style barbecue in the city. Straightforward classics like smoked brisket and baby back ribs are always a strong choice, but there are also options like pork belly tacos and a lamb belly banh mi. The space is sprawling in a way that feels like the real deal, and Durney himself can usually be found working the room, and keeping a watchful eye on the smoking meats. It''s counter service only, and there''s often a line, but for the scene and certainly for the meat, it''s easily worth the trip to Red Hook.','October 26, 2016','2025-01-27 10:23:17');

Started with a strawberry margarita which was good in flavor but not much alcohol. Had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and it was really good. Great balance in flavor and a good portion. Extra tasty with their hot sauces. My wife had the lamb but it was a bit too salty for our taste. Although, it was cooked very well and fell off the bone. The highlight of the night was the tres leches cake. Probably the best I''ve ever had to be honest. Not too sweet and very milky. Overall, one of my top 3 favorite Mexican in NY.','October 26, 2016','2025-01-27 10:23:17');
